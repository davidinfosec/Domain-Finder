# Domain-Finder
Domain Finder is a Python script that I created to speed up the process in finding available domain names online. It's a simple script that takes 2 word lists, concatenates them together, and adds a TLD of choice. It also copies the output to clipboard and a textfile. The script is hard-coded and isn't optimized, as it was just for personal use.
